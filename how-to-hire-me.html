    <h1>How to hire Ashley Blewer</h1>

    <h2>Why?</h2>

        <p>First, maybe you are wondering why you should hire me. You should hire me if you:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>1. Care about transparency. I am fully committed to free and open
          source software, sources, drafts, workflows, and
          everything else.</li>
          <li>2. Care about sustainability. It is essential that I leave clients
          empowered to understand their own systems, and I think simple
          solutions are better than convoluted situations.</li>
          <li>3. Care about communication. Between colleagues working towards a
          goal or from your technology to your audience, you need clear, quick, and
          cordial correspondance. I am an empathetic translator across technical
          levels, from systems engineers to novice computer users.</li>
        </ul>

        <p></p>
        <p>Okay, now here are some vehicles through which we can work together.</p>
        <h2>Artefactual</h2>

        <p>I work full time at <a
        href="https://www.artefactual.com/">Artefactual Systems</a>. You can
        hire me by making an inquiry there. This is a good option if you want to work with myself and
        a team of experts in all aspects of digital preservation planning, workflow analysis, metadata, technical
        implementation and systems administration, and more. This is also a good
        choice if you definitely want me to do it and to do it soon, as this is my full-time job and I am
        full-time available for it.</p>

        <h2>MediaArea</h2>

        <p>I am available to hire through <a
        href="https://mediaarea.net/">MediaArea</a>. This is a good option if
        you are primarily interested in my expertise in audiovisual preservation, my
        ability to communicate difficult audiovisual concepts to non-technical
        audiences, or general work in media analysis with a senior support
        team. This is also a good option if you need to work with a company based in Europe.</p>

        <h2>Direct hire</h2>

        <p>Of course, you can always hire me directly, which is cheaper and has
        less overhead. However, availability is
        limited and projects must be appropriately scoped for me to take on.
        This is a good choice if you have a concrete
        project in mind (such as documentation of an existing tool, a
        preservation workflow gap analysis, data/software
        migration project planning, or a training/teaching opportunity). I
        welcome programming projects if they are a
        suitable size, but I cannot accept ambiguously defined projects (i.e.
        some front-end programming, design work, a bit of back-end development,
        backups of the site, and DNS routing work).</p>

        <p>If I am too busy, I may be able to connect you with someone else who
        can help. I know many talented people!</p>

        <h2>Just want to say thanks</h2>

        <p>If you appreciate my free and open resources and don't or can't hire me to do something specific for you, you
        could metaphorically buy me a coffee as a way to say you appreciate
        these services. For that, you can use <a
        href="https://paypal.me/ablwr">Paypal.me</a>.But perhaps it is better to
        donate to a charity like <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic
        Frontier Foundation</a> or the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet
        Archive</a>, or a small, local organization.</p>

        <h2>But I don't have any money</h2>

        <p>Are you an individual or a very small organization just trying to wrap your head around a specific problem, like
        what to do with a couple dozen old video tapes or how to keep digital objects
        minimally stable over time? I'd be happy to set you down the right path
        with a free consultation and recommendations how to get started on your
        own. No strings attached!</p>
